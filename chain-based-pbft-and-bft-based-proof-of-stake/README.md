# Chain-based PBFT and BFT-based Proof of Stake

Byzantine Fault Tolerance \(BFT\) consensus

### Pros

* BFT provide strong finality guarantees in that either all honest nodes will adopt a block or none will \(thus eliminating the possibility of forks and rollbacks found in Bitcoin\) 

### Cons

* Existing BFT algorithms normally do not scale well.
