# leaderless BFT dual ledger architecture

a decentralized ledger system that features a leaderless, fully-local and scalable consensus algorithm based on virtual voting coupled with proof of work and proof of stake anti-sybil \[6\] mechanisms that reaches eventual consensus with probability one. The concept of virtual voting was known long before in the literature, starting with the pioneering paper ”ByzantineResistant Total Ordering Algorithms” \[5\] by Moser and Melliar-Smith where they formulated four algorithms to establish a total ordering from network events. The peculiar concept of virtual voting that later reappeared in other papers such as Hashgraph \[8\], PARSEC \[9\] or Blockmania \[51\], was the ability to execute a virtual agreement protocol, as authors Moser and Melliar-Smith cleverly observed long before and exploited the fact that votes weren’t explicitly contained in the messages, but were deducted from the causal relationships between them.
