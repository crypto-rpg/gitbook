# Snowglobe

The pre-consensus Snowglobe protocol would run parallel with the original proof-of-work consensus mechanism and it has a variety of different benefits.

Software developer Tyler Smith recently published specifications to a new concept he has created called Snowglobe.  __From the documentation:

“This document specifies a propagation protocol for nodes of a Nakamoto Consensus network in which participants actively work to reconcile their local states against each other,” the Snowglobe specs state. “It enables nodes to sample each others’ state in order to determine which item in a conflict set is currently chosen by the most nodes, and to work toward a super majority of nodes choosing the same set of items.”

"An Avalanche-based consensus algorithm is used for this process affording the protocol asynchrony, metastability, and quiescent finality."

“Using Avalanche in Bitcoin Cash for miner coordination provides a very elegant, decentralized coordination mechanism that can potentially prevent miners from accepting double spend bribes and when combined with double spend notifications, make \[zero-confirmation\] transactions very secure,” Pacia said at the time. In February 2019, Pacia and fellow BCHD developers [revealed](https://twitter.com/ChrisPacia/status/1093722089234853889) that an “Avalanche proof of concept is officially running on mainnet.”

_The whitepaper describe_ four different protocols called Slush, Snowflake, Snowball, and Avalanche.
